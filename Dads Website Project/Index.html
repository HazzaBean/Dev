<!-- Basic Ideas for This Page -

Blur backgrounds, potentially able to overlay small amounts of text this way

Keep margin and padding to a minimum between images, maybe 10/12 cols per image reversing as the page goes down

Potentially no need for a navbar - only things showing on the page are services and contact.

Landing Image > off center logo with explore button, this takes you to the about section just below -

In the about section, a little bit of information about experience, range of work, specialisations etc.

Next come the "services", which will show everything that can be offered, this will be overlayed onto pictures.

Potential extra services (talk to dad about these)

General Property Maintenance
Plastering
Home Improvements
